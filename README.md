Lessons learned:
This was one of my first experiences setting up an API app on a website, and I definitely learned some things about choosing an API, 
avoiding CORS errors, being detail-oriented about file paths, and unix time stamps. I tried my hand for the first time at CSS animation and 
I think it really adds something to the overall look and feel of the site.
